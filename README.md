VCFANNO
----------

VCFANNO was designed to annotate VCF/BCF files by using local and online databases. The early propose was design an efficient standalone program and put all the annotate informations in the seperated tags in VCF file.

Before you try to use VCFANNO, please make sure you know how to find the document of [VCF/BCF format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf).



**The design of vcfanno**

The VCF file are currently most used to store genomic variants and other related information. For other The INFO column of VCF/BCF file could specify all possible information related with variants in one position, and 
The core VCFANNO [htslib](http://htslib.org/)





**How to build the programs**







**Write configure file.**





**Generate databases for annotation.**
