Getting started with BCFANNO
================

bcfanno was designed to annotate genetic variants with various biological databases and predict the variant types and HGVS names quickly. 
Here are some easy instructions to get you up and running toy data.

## Installing bcfanno

Download the source code or binary distribution from https://github.com/shiquan/bcfanno/releases

Or cloning from github, get the most updated version :
```
git clone https://github.com/shiquan/bcfanno
cd bcfanno && make
```

## Test toy data

Run bcfanno with toy data :

```
# stdout output
./bcfanno -c toy.json example/toy.vcf.gz

# Or save results to a compressed VCF :
./bcfanno -c toy.json example/toy.vcf.gz -O z -o results.vcf.gz

# Or save as bcf :
./bcfanno -c toy.json example/toy.vcf.gz -O b -o results.bcf
```

## Select annotations from result
**vcf2tsv** is an additional program in bcfanno package, use to convert VCF/BCF file to user-friendly tab-seperated-variants file.
```
./bcfanno -c toy.json example/toy.vcf.gz -q | ./vcf2tsv -f CHROM,POS,CytoBand,REF,ALT,GT,SAMPLE,RS,VarType,Gene,HGVSnom,ExonIntron,AAlength,HGMD_disease,HGMD_tag,HGMD_pmid

## Another usage
./bcfanno -c toy.json example/toy.vcf.gz -q | ./vcf2tsv -f BED,CytoBand,TGT,SAMPLE,RS,VarType,Gene,HGVSnom,ExonIntron,AAlength,HGMD_disease,HGMD_tag,HGMD_pmid

```

## (Optional) View your view with Microsoft excel
This step is optional, need to install my another program [tsv2excel](https://github.com/shiquan/tsv2excel) first.
```
./bcfanno -c toy.json example/toy.vcf.gz -q | ./vcf2tsv -f BED,CytoBand,TGT,SAMPLE,RS,VarType,Gene,HGVSnom,ExonIntron,AAlength,HGMD_disease,HGMD_tag,HGMD_pmid | tsv2excel -o toy.xlsx
```


## Additional programs included in bcfanno package

Beside the core program ***bcfanno***, belowed programs will also be generated in the package.

* [***tsv2vcf***]() ,  generate VCF databases from tab-seperated file
* [***vcf2tsv***](), convert VCF file to tab-separated file with selected tags
* [***vcf_rename_tags***](), rename tags or contig names in the VCF file, usually used to format the databases
* [***GenePredExtGen***]() Generate genepredext format with genome annotation and reference databases.
